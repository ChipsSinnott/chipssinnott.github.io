    <p>Polixenes, King of Bohemia, has come to stay with his friend King Leontes of Sicily, but there is tension in the court as Leontes starts to suspect him of infidelity with his pregnant wife Hermione. With Polixenes forced to flee Sicily, Leontes imprisons his wife and orders his newborn daughter to be exiled. Hermione faints from grief and is thought to be dead, and a heartbroken Leontes begs for forgiveness. Left in the woods of Bohemia, the baby is found by a shepherd...</p>
    <p>One of Shakespeare’s final plays, The Winter’s Tale is a bittersweet comedy of two halves, offering a melancholic harmony of loss and jealousy with reunion and forgiveness. At some times tragic and others beautiful and magical, Shakespeare invites us to watch as friendships and families fall apart only to marvel as they are brought back together. As Leontes’s daughter Perdita returns to Sicily, the play leads us to an ambiguous yet moving climax in which Hermione appears to be reborn through a statue.</p>
